# label_artifacts
label_artifacts is an application for manually labelling CT image datasets. In particular, we are interested in which patients have metal dental artifacts, but the code can easily be adapted to other questions.

## Usage
In order to start the app, simply log into the data transfer node on the HPC4Health cluster with X11 forwarding enabled.
```bash
$ ssh -X -p 22 username@172.27.23.173 ```
